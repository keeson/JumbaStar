Under this folder is the detailed code I used to apply different features to the naive bayes model

The general steps for each specific set of feature under this model is the same, but the details are different.

I labled python files 1 to 4. You can get the final auc by just following this order.

You can expect at most 7 files for each of the folders. If you found some folders with less than 7 files, it means at that part we have skipped that certain steps.
